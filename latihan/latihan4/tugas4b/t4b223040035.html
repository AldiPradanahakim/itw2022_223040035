        <h2>What is football?</h2>

       <p>Association football (English: Association Football or Soccer) or simply football is a team sport, in which each player generally plays a special ball (called soccer ball) with their feet on a special field. This sport is played by two teams, each consisting of 11 (eleven) core players and several reserve players. Entering the 21st century, this sport has been played by more than 250 million people in 200 countries. Football aims to score as many goals as possible by entering the ball into the opponent's goal. Football is played in an open rectangular field, on grass or artificial turf.</p>
       
       <p>In general, only the goalkeeper is entitled to touch the ball with his hands or arms inside his goal area, while 10 (ten) other players are allowed to use their whole body other than the hands, usually with the feet to kick, the chest to control, and the head to head the ball. The team that scores the most goals at the end of the game wins. If until the end of time it still ends in a draw, then a draw, extra time or penalty shoot-out can be made, depending on the format of the championship. From an official match, 3 points are awarded to the winning team, 0 points to the losing team and 1 point each to the two teams that drew.However, the winner of a football match can be canceled at any time due to scandals and criminal acts that are proven at a later date. A football match can be won automatically by a team by 3-0 if the opposing team intentionally withdraws from the match (walk out).
        The general rules of the game are updated annually by the parent organization of international football (FIFA), which also organizes the World Cup every four years.</p>

        <h2>Regulation</h2><hr>
        <h3>Football field</h3>
        <div class="heroo-football"></div>
        <p>For adult international matches, the international football fields used have a length that ranges from 100-120 meters and a width of 65-75 meters. In the middle of both ends of the field, there is a goal area in the form of a rectangle measuring 7.32 meters wide and 2.44 meters high. In front of the goal there is a penalty area which is 16.5 meters from the goal. This area is the limit where goalkeepers can catch the ball with their hands and determine when a violation is awarded a penalty kick or not.</p>
        
        <h3>Match lenght</h3>
        <p>The normal length of a football game is 2 X 45 minutes, plus a 15 minute break between the two halves. If the position is equal, then an extra time is held for 2 X 15 minutes, until the winner is obtained, but if they are equal, a penalty shoot-out will be held. The referee can determine the amount of extra time at the end of each half as a substitute for time lost due to substitutions, injuries requiring assistance, or other stoppages. This additional time is referred to as injury time or stoppage time.
            Goals scored in extra time will count towards the final score of the match, whereas goals from the penalty shootout only determine if a team can advance to the next match or not (does not affect the final score). In the late 1990s, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) imposed a golden goal or silver goal system for completing matches. In the gold goal system, the team that scores first during extra time will be the winner, while in the silver goal, the team leading at the end of the first half of extra time will come out the winner. Both systems are no longer used by IFAB.</p>
        
        <h3>violation</h3>
        <p>If a player commits a violation that is hard enough, the referee can give a warning with a yellow card or a red card. The game will be stopped for a moment and the referee shows the card in front of the offending player then records his name in the book. A yellow card is a warning for violations such as being unsportsmanlike, constantly breaking the rules, disagreeing with words or actions, delaying the restart of the match, going in and out of the match without the referee's approval, or not keeping a distance from opposing players who are taking free kicks. or throw-in. The player who receives two yellow cards will get a red card and exit the game.
            red card The player who gets a red card must leave the match without being replaced by another player. Some examples of actions that can be rewarded with a red card are a serious foul that endangers or causes serious injury to the opponent, spitting, committing violence, violating an opponent who is trying to score a goal, touching the ball with his hands to prevent a goal for all players except the goalkeeper, and using language or gestures that tend to be challenging, players who play as goalkeepers do hands ball outside the penalty box.</p>
        
        <h3>Referee and match officials</h3>
        <div class="herooo-football"></div>
        <p>In a professional match, there are 4 officers who lead the game, namely the referee, 2 lines judges, and an officer on the edge of the center of the field and the goal umpire who is on the edge of the goal. The referee has a whistle indicating whether to stop or start playing the ball. He is also in charge of giving penalties and warnings for violations that occur in the field. Each line guard is responsible for overseeing half of the field. They carry a flag with a bright color to indicate a foul, the ball is out, or offside. Usually they will move to follow the position of the last defender.
            The final officer has the task of keeping track of all the time that was stopped during the match and providing information about the extra time at the end of each half. This officer is also in charge of checking substitutions and being a liaison between team managers and referees. In some matches, the use of video technology or the use of a fifth person to determine the accuracy of the referee's decisions is starting to be used. For example that determines whether a ball has crossed the line or whether a player is in an offside state when scoring a goal.</p>
